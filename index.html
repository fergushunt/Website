		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			Graduated Computer Science in Trinity College Dublin in 2018.<br />

			 I'm currently a developer in <a href="ultantechnologies.com">Ultan Technologies</a> after completing an internship with them. I've outlined some of the projects I have worked on below.<br />

			My first job was as a bike mechanic in <a href="trailblazers.ie">Trailblazers Bike and Outdoor Store</a> in Carrick on Shannon. I mostly built, assessed, and repaired bikes, when necessary I assisted customers with advice and made sales when necessary.<br />

			For the summers of 2015 to 2017 I worked as an Instructor in <a href="zipit.ie">Zipit</a> in Lough Key Forest Park in Boyle. This entailed teaching customers how to use the course, working as part of a team to complete safety checks and repairs to make sure the course is safe for customers.
		</p>

		<p class="disclaimer">
			<i>I want to be absolutely clear that I did not in any way create, build, maintain, or design the sites of Trailblazers or Zipit. On the other hand, I did design the current Ultan Technologies website.</i>
		</p>

		<h2>Some of my Technical Projects</h2>
		<p>
			<br />
			<h4 class="heading">Automated Testing Application</h4> <br />
			I created an application to test the processing of data uploaded by users to a hosted system. I extended a pre-existing framework using Selenium WebDriver to log onto the website and download the data to be tested. I used the Excel Interoperability library to move the data downloaded into preformatted test sheets, and to adjust the calculations performed in the sheets at runtime based on the data downloaded. This application allows developers to run tests faster and more often, this allows bugs to be caught more quickly after any changes are made to the system.
			<br />

			<h4 class="heading">File Management System</h4><br />
			I created an automated file management system which organised automatically generated files into folders and subfolders based on file metadata. A subsection of these files were then served to the customer. This system was built on a number of AWS servers. I created the program to organise the files on a pre-existing server. The organised files were passed to an S3 instance for long term storage and as a copy. To reduce the load on this server I set up a different EC2 instance to  serve the files to the customer. This server used FTPS to allow the client to access the files. To avoid filling the server with out of date files, any files more than 30 days old were deleted.
